# Gnosis Safe Address Book

## :warning: IMPORTANT :warning:
Always double check the commit history before importing addresses from this repository into a new Gnosis Safe browser

## Usage
Import me into Gnosis Safe so that addresses can be auto replaced within the UI for more human readable strings. This is sourced controlled so we can monitor changes as this can be incredibly dangerous. Go to `ADDRESS BOOK` in the left side bar and then tap Import at the top right
